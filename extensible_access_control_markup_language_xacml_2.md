# eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) Part 2

## Review

### XACML

* OASIS standard
* Federate administration of policies about the same resource 
* XACML Core Specification 
  * attribute-based access control policy language 
    * implemented in XML
    * default attributes and functions
  * language to express access requests and responses 
  * policy evaluation process 
  * high-level architecture (PEP, PDP, PIP, PAP, etc.)

### XACML Architecture

![XACMLArchitecture](image/XACMLArchitecture.png)

### XACML Policy Model

 ![XACMLPolicyModel](image/XACMLPolicyModel.png)

### Access Request & Policy Applicability

 ![accessrequestpolicyapplicability](image/accessrequestpolicyapplicability.png)

* Access Requests specify a context 
  * Attributes of subject, object, action, environment

* A Rule/Policy/PolicySet has a target 
  * Attributes of subject, object, action, environment

* Rule/Policy/PolicySet is applicable if the attributes in the accessrequest “match” the attributes in the target

### Access Decision

* Permit: requested access is permitted 
* Deny: requested access is denied 
* Indeterminate: PDP is unable to evaluate the request 
* NotApplicable: PDP does not have any policy that applies to the request

**REMARK**: Attributes in the target have attribute *MustBePresent*. In case that no matching attribute is present in the request, then the attribute is considered missing. If the attribute is missing, then *MustBePresent* governs the applicability of the Rule/Policy/PolicySet

* If *MustBePresent* is “False” (default value), then a missing attribute results in “NotApplicable”
* If *MustBePresent* is “True”, then a missing attribute results in“Indeterminate”

### Extended Indeterminate Set

Record potential effect value when errors occur 

* Indeterminate{P} (I{P}) 
* Indeterminate{D} (I{D}) 
* Indeterminate{PD} (I{PD})

Used by some combining algorithms

### Decision Set Projection

 ![DecisionSetProjection](image/DecisionSetProjection.png)

### Combining Algorithms

* Deny-overrides 

* Ordered-deny-overrides 

* Permit-overrides 

* Ordered-permit-overrides 

* Permit-unless-deny 

* Deny-unless-permit 

* First-applicable 

* Only-one-applicable

   ![CombiningAlgorithms](image/CombiningAlgorithms.png)

### Obligations

* In XACML **post obligations** 
* A policy or policy set may contain one or more obligations
* Obligations passed up to the next level of evaluation 
* No obligations are passed up 
  * if the policy or policy set is not evaluated 
  * if result is “Indeterminate” or “NotApplicable” 
  * if effect does not match FulfillOn attribute

### Response

## Outline

* RBAC Profile
* Privacy Profile
* Exercise

## RBAC Profile

### RBAC

![RBAC](image/RBAC.png)

Facilitate policy specification and management

* RBAC0 
  * Roles based on job functions 
  * Users assigned to roles 
  * Permissions assigned to roles

* RBAC1 = RBAC0 + Role hierarchy 
* RBAC2 = RBAC0 + Constraints 
* RBAC3 = RBAC1 + RBAC2

### RBAC0

 ![RBAC0](image/RBAC0.png)

### RBAC1

 ![RBAC1](image/RBAC1.png)

### RBAC Profile - Scope

RBAC profile answers three types of questions:

1. If a subject X has roles R1,R2, …,Rn enabled, is X allowed to perform a given action on a given resource?
2. Is subject X allowed to have role Ri enabled?
3. If a subject X has roles R1,R2, …,Rn enabled, does that meanX will have permissions associated with a given role R'? 
   1. In other word, is role R' either equal to or junior to any of roles R1,R2, …,Rn?

NOT supported 
* Separation of Duty


### Policies in RBAC Profile

**Role**: < PolicySet > that associates permissions with a role 

**Permission**: < PolicySet > that define permissions 

**Role Assignment**: < Policy > or < PolicySet > that defines which roles can be assigned to a subject

* Actual assignment of roles to users outside scope of XACML PDP

**HasPrivilegesOfRole**: < Policy > in a Permission< PolicySet > that supports requests asking whether a subject has the privileges associated with a given role

### RBAC0 in XACML

**User** expressed using XACML Subjects 

**Roles** 

* Single attribute identifier and an attribute value for each role(recommended) 
  * urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:subject:role
* An attribute identifier for each role (empty value)
  * urn:someapp:attributes:employee-role
* Same representation within a policy domain

**Objects** expressed using XACML Resources

**Operations** expressed using XACML Actions 

**Permissions** expressed using Permission < PolicySet > 

**Permissions-Role Assignment** expressed using Role< PolicySet >

### Role < PolicySet >

Determine whether a subject holds a certain role 

* < Target > of Role < PolicySet > limits the applicability of the < PolicySet > to subjects holding a ceratin role 
* Each Role < PolicySet > references a single Permission < PolicySet > 
  * No contain or reference any other < Policy >or < PolicySet >

![Role<PolicySet>](image/Role<PolicySet>.png)

### Permission < PolicySet >

Define the permissions associated to a certain role 

* One Permission < PolicySet > for each role 
* Permission < PolicySet > contains < Policy > and < Rule > elements that describe the resources and actions that subjects are permitted to access 
* < Target > MUST NOT limit the subjects to which the < PolicySet > is applicable 
  * including contained or referenced PolicySet/Policy/Rule

  ![Permission<PolicySet>](image/Permission<PolicySet>.png)


### Example

![RBACProfileExample](image/RBACProfileExample.png)

Role < PolicySet > for employees
![Role<PolicySet>foremployees](image/Role<PolicySet>foremployees.png)

Permission < PolicySet > for employees ![Permission<PolicySet>foremployees](image/Permission<PolicySet>foremployees.png)

### Evaluation

Permission < PolicySet > cannot be used as initial policy by PDP 

Permission < PolicySet > MUST be reachable only through the corresponding Role Permission < PolicySet > 

* To support inheritance, Permission < PolicySet > must be applicable to any subject

### RBAC1 in XACML

**Role inheritance** defined by policy structure 

Permissions associated with one role includes permissions associated with more general roles

### Permission < PolicySet >

Define the permissions associated to a certain role 

* One Permission < PolicySet > for each role 
* Permission < PolicySet > contains < Policy > and< Rule > elements that describe the resources and actions that subjects are permitted to access 
* < Target >, if present, MUST NOT limit the subjects to which the < PolicySet > is applicable  
  * including contained or referenced PolicySet/Policy/Rule
* Permission < PolicySet > MAY also contain references to Permission < PolicySet >s associated with other roles that are generalizations of the given role 
  * Inherit all permissions associated with the role of the referenced Permission < PolicySet >

### Example

 ![RBAC1XACMLExample](image/RBAC1XACMLExample.png)

### Multi-Role Permissions

A user must hold several roles simultaneously to gain access to a certain permission 

* < Target > of Role < PolicySet > requires specifying all roles 
  * a single < AllOf > element containing multiple < Match >elements 
* Associated Permission < PolicySet > specifies permission associated with subjects who have all role enabled 
* Associated Permission < PolicySet > may refer to Permission< PolicySet >s associated with individual roles 
* All necessary roles have to be specified in Request context

Subjects has the permissions associated with 

* each role individually 
* multi roles

### HasPrivilegesOfRole < Policy >

Used to allow queries asking if a subject “**has the privileges of**” a specific role 

Included in a Permission < PolicySet > 

If this type of request is to be supported, then a HasPrivilegesOfRole < Policy > MUST be included in each Permission < PolicySet >

 ![HasPrivilegesOfRole<Policy>](image/HasPrivilegesOfRole<Policy>.png)

### HasPrivilegesOfRole < Policy > for managers

 ![HasPrivilegesOfRole<Policy>formanagers](image/HasPrivilegesOfRole<Policy>formanagers.png)

### HasPrivilegesOfRole < Request > 

 ![HasPrivilegesOfRole<Request>](image/HasPrivilegesOfRole<Request>.png)


## Privacy Profile

### Privacy-aware Access Control

Access control policies include **Subject** ,**Object** ,**Actions**

Privacy-aware access control policies also include

* **Purpose**: the intended use of data 
* **Obligations**: mandatory requirements to be fulfilled
* **Conditions**: restrictions under which a policy is applied

### Privacy Profile

No element for purpose 

Two optional purpose attributes: 

* urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:resource:purpose 
  * purpose for which data were collected
* urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:action:purpose 
  * purpose for which data are requested

No purpose hierarchy

### Matching purpose
